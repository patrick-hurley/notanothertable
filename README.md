## About The Project

You're given a desktop design that includes a table and now need to make that display nicely on a screen that's 600px wide. "Ergh, not another...". You get the idea.

**nat.js** allows you to write code in semantic ``<table>`` markup, converting it to a ``<div>`` based responsive version. Utilising the ``role`` attribute, the tables remain suitable for those using screen readers as their ``<table>`` counterparts, as well as looking great on mobile.


## Usage
